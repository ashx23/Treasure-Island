## Treasure Island

# Instructions

Make your own "Choose Your Own Adventure" game. Use conditionals such as `if`, `else`, and `elif` statements to lay out the logic and the story's path in your program. 

However, I think the fun part is writing your *own* story 😊

🧞‍♂️ 🐊 🧙‍♂️ 🧟 🧚‍♂️ 🧝‍♂️ 🥷 🤖 👽 🙀 

That said if you'd like to continue with my example, feel free to use the text snippets below...

### Text Snippets from my example

* 'You\'re at a crossroad. Where do you want to go? Type "left" or "right"'
* 'You\'ve come to a lake. There is an island in the middle of the lake. Type "wait" to wait for a boat. Type "swim" to swim across.'
* "You arrive at the island unharmed. There is a house with 3 doors. One red, one yellow and one blue. Which colour do you choose?"
* "It's a room full of fire. Game Over."
* "You found the treasure! You Win!"
* "You enter a room of beasts. Game Over."
* "You chose a door that doesn't exist. Game Over."
* "You get attacked by an angry trout. Game Over."
* "You fell into a hole. Game Over."





# Extensions

Have a think about how you might write your program to make a player's answers less case-sensitive. In other words, your code should work regardless of whether your user answers "left" or "Left".
